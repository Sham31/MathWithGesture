Introducing The Virtual Calculator - Where Al Meets Math!

I've developed a Virtual Calculator using OpenCV and GenAl. This machine can solve any math problem, no matter how complex, by interpreting visual drawings

1. Draw your equation (keep index finger up)

2. Navigate the canvas (two fingers up)

3. Reset/erase (thumb up)

4. Submit for solving (three  finger up)

The user draws the math problem on the screen, and this visual representation is sent to Google's Gemini LLM model. The model interprets the drawing and provides a detailed solution.

Interestingly, Apple introduced a similar feature in their iPad calculator at the latest WWDC

I'm open to suggestions to make this project better. Your feedback is always welcome:)
